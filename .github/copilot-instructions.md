# OSINT Caf√© - AI-Powered Cybersecurity & Verification Platform

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive cybersecurity investigation and digital verification platform built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with blockchain verification to provide users with tools to stay safe online.

## Core Features

1. **Dating & Relationship Safety** - Romance scam detection and prevention with AI-powered verification
2. **AI Investigation Assistant** - Interactive chat with AI avatar for threat analysis
3. **Blockchain Verification** - Live blockchain dashboard with cryptographic identity verification
4. **Real-time Threat Intelligence** - Live scam detection feeds and community awareness
5. **Interactive Safety Education** - Gamified learning with audio guides and multimedia content

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cybersecurity theme
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons, Framer Motion animations
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **File Handling**: React Dropzone for file uploads
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast

## Design System

- **Color Palette**: Dark theme with cyber-blue (#00f5ff), cyber-green (#39ff14), and accent orange (#ff6b35)
- **Typography**: Inter for body text, Orbitron for headings and cyber elements
- **Components**: Consistent cyber-themed borders, glow effects, and animations
- **Layout**: Mobile-first responsive design with modern grid layouts

## Code Patterns

- Use TypeScript interfaces defined in `src/types/index.ts`
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use Framer Motion for animations and page transitions
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Create reusable components in `src/components/`
- Organize pages in `src/pages/`
- Keep business logic in `src/services/` and custom hooks in `src/hooks/`

## AI Integration Guidelines

- Simulate AI responses with realistic cybersecurity insights
- Implement proper loading states for AI interactions
- Use toast notifications for user feedback
- Design for future integration with real AI APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)

## Security & Privacy Focus

- Always prioritize user privacy and data protection
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use secure coding practices for all user interactions
- Design with cybersecurity best practices in mind

## Component Development

- Use consistent prop interfaces and TypeScript types
- Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follow responsive design patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain consistent spacing and layout patterns using Tailwind utilities

When developing new features or components, ensure they align with the cybersecurity theme and provide real value to users protecting themselves online.
